## Troubleshooting

### I'm deploying a Postgres database via helm and after uninstalling and reinstalling it, I can't connect.
This is probably due to Helm not deleting the PersistentVolumeClaims of the database, so that the data won't accidentaly be deleted along with the helm chart release.

-   Uninstall the helm chart
-   Delete the pvc: `kubectl delete pvc data-<RELEASE_NAME>-postgresql-0` (release_name is usually miniurl)
-   Reinstall the helm chart

### When switching to Postgres storage I get "wrong password" error
-  Check if you have Postgres installed locally and remove it or kill the process.
## Common issues

### How do I create a new migration in the Storage Relational driver?
-   cd to src/services/storage/drivers/relational folder
-   run `npx knex migrate:make <MIGRATION_NAME> -x ts --migrations-directory migrations`

### My urls keep getting erased on development mode!
That's OK. The development mode uses the InMemory storage driver, which means that it saves everything inside a simple JS object. On every server restart, that project will be erased and the data will be lost.

If you want to persist the data, you can edit the .env.development file and change the storage driver.

### How can I run a local postgres database for development purposes?
-   Make sure you have Docker installed
-   Run `docker run -d --name postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -p 5432:5432 postgres`
-   On .env.development, comment the InMemory Storage section and uncomment the Relational Storage section
