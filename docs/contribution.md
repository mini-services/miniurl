## Troubleshooting

### I'm deploying a Postgres database via helm and after uninstalling and reinstalling it, I can't connect.
This is probably due to Helm not deleting the PersistentVolumeClaims of the database, so that the data won't accidentaly be deleted along with the helm chart release.

-   Uninstall the helm chart
-   Delete the pvc: `kubectl delete pvc data-<RELEASE_NAME>-postgresql-0` (release_name is usually miniurl)
-   Reinstall the helm chart

## Common issues

### How do I create a new migration in the Storage Relational driver?
-   cd to src/services/storage/drivers/relational folder
-   run `npx knex migrate:make <MIGRATION_NAME> -x ts --migrations-directory migrations`

### How can I run a local postgres database for development purposes?
-   Make sure you have Docker installed
-   Run `docker run -d --name postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -p 5432:5432 postgres`
-   On .env.development, comment the InMemory Storage section and uncomment the Relational Storage section
