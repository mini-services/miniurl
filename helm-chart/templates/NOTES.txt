Miniurl has been successfully installed.

Miniurl is now accessible at:

In-cluster access:
* {{ include "miniurl.serviceName" . }}:80/:id - redirects
* {{ include "miniurl.serviceName" . }}:80/miniurl/* - API

External access:
{{ if .Values.ingress.enable }}
* {{ .Values.baseRedirectUrl }}/:id - redirect to the shortened URL
* <ANY-HOST>/miniurl/* - Miniurl's API
{{ else }}
Since you have not enabled the ingress route, Miniurl is not accessible from outside the cluster.
{{ end }}

Enjoy!
